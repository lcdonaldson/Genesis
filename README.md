** At this point there are 66 active repos but almost all of them need to be archived, turned private or just deleted. However, If this is done before a year of them being inactive then it removes my tracked progress in the coding chart. So I will be eliminating these one by one as they reach that year mark. Therefore, my inital repo count will climb dramatically before falling back down to a manageable number over this next year. **
